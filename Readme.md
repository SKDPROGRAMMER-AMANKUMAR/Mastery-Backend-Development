# This is the in-depth Documentation for this Backend Series.

## 2 major components

### 1.  A programming language mastry(JS)
### 2.  A Database (Mongo,MySQL,PostgreSQL etc.) 

# <strong style="color:Yellow;">A JavaScript Based Backend Contains:</strong>
>> 1. Data (it can be in any datatype like string,array,boolean,number etc.)
>> 2. File (Images,Videos,PDF etc.)
>> 3. Third Party API (google login , facebook login etc. )
### A JS Runtime : Node.js/Deno/Bun

## <strong style="color:Red">working of JS files and folders:</strong>
>> 1.<strong style="color:orange">index.js</strong> {Here we connect DB with our backend}
>> 2.<strong style="color:orange">App.js</strong>  {configuration(config),cookies,urlencoded etc.}
>> 3.<strong style="color:orange">constants.js</strong>  {enums,DB-name etc.}
>> <strong style="color:purple;">The above 3 are files and below are folders </strong>
>> 4.<strong style="color:orange">DB</strong> {Here in this case we write the code to connect backend with DB and export it to the "index.js" file}
>> 5.<strong style="color:orange">Models</strong> {Here we make Shemas and sturctures of DATA that how the data will get stored in DB}
>> 6.<strong style="color:orange">Controllers</strong> {This contains the functions or methods , means at what route what function or method will execute and it also do all the stuff with data. }
>> 7.<strong style="color:orange">Routes</strong> {Here in this case we defined Routes of our web applications like (/login,/register,/,/signup) etc.}
>> 8.<strong style="color:orange">Middlewares</strong> {Here we write the middlewares for our web apps}
>> 9.<strong style="color:orange">Utils</strong> {This means utilities , basically we write the functions or methods that most of the time used in the application , so that we don't have to write it each time }

## Commands of creating a simple server (localhost:port)

```javascript
 npm init //Command 1. This initializes the server and by writing this command we can install any package and it make the package.json file where the all information of your app available .
{
  "name": "chaibackend",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "a basic app to deploy",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Aman Kumar",
  "license": "ISC"
}
//The above code is of Package.json, and we can make our own "scripts" commands to run the application , like below we've make it .
"scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
  // so by entering "npm run start" command in terminal the app will get live and run

  npm install express //Command 2. This will install the express for our web app including node_modules where the all the folders and file that will required for our app. 
  npm install dotenv //Command 3. This will install dotenv for our web app , so that we can use (.env) file to store the important and sensitive information about our app like (DB url, PORT etc. )
```

## The code written below is the basic  that how you can make the server by using "Express" and also follow the link that commented at the end of the code 

```javascript
 //The code written below is in "index.js" file
 import express from 'express';
import { configDotenv } from 'dotenv'; //This is for (.env) file
const app = express();/*The comment clearly explains that this line of code creates an instance of the Express application, which is a fundamental step in setting up an Express.js server.*/
const port = 3000 || process.env.PORT // Define the port number on which the server will listen, and if our defined port is get busy in users device then it will automatically use the port that get provided by the platform where you deploye your app because of this(|| process.env.PORT)

Frontend Code ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡

we make the React app with vite 
```javascript 
//This is in "App.jsx" file
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import './App.css'
import axios from "axios"

function App() {
  const [jokes, setJokes] = useState([])

  useEffect(()=>{
    axios.get("/api/jokes")
    .then((response)=>{
       setJokes(response.data)
    })
    .catch((error)=>{
      console.log("Error:",error.message);
    })
  })

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Chai and full stack</h1>
      <p>JOKES:{jokes.length}</p>

      {
        jokes.map((joke,index) => (
          <div key={joke.id}>
            <h2>{joke.title}</h2>
            <p>{joke.content}</p>
          </div>
        ))
      }
    </>
  )
}

export default App

This is the main and most important in frontent (vite.config.js), The below Code is for avoiding the "CORS" ERROR

import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

// https://vite.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  server:{  /* Configure the server to act as a reverse proxy for API requests.
     This allows the server to forward incoming requests from the '/api' endpoint to a separate server running on 'http://localhost:8080'.
     This is useful for development environments where the frontend and backend are running on different ports or servers.*/
    proxy:{ /* The '/api' endpoint is the entry point for API requests on the current server.
       Any requests made to this endpoint will be forwarded to the target server.*/
      '/api':'http://localhost:8080'

# <strong style="color:cyan; font-family:serif;" >From Here We are moving towards Professional and Production grade backend that used in big companies</strong>

[Link of model for project that we will in this professional backend](https://app.eraser.io/workspace/YtPqZ1VogxGy1jzIDkzj)

[This website will create all the things that should go inside (.gitignore) file and it is professional approach](https://mrkandreev.name/snippets/gitignore-generator/#Node) Here we simply use it for "Node" but you can use for any other framework or library or language.

## File Structure for production grade web apps

>>This document provides a structured overview of the backend project, explaining the purpose of each folder and file in the application.

```javascript
â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ Contains all the installed dependencies and packages used in the project. This folder is generated automatically by npm based on package.json and should not be modified directly.
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ Static files served directly to clients without requiring backend processing. â”‚ â””â”€â”€ temp/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ A subdirectory within public intended for temporarily storing files, such as uploads or files in processing. â”‚ â””â”€â”€ .gitkeep
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ An empty file used to retain the temp directory in version control (Git), since Git does not track empty directories by default. â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ The main source folder that holds the core backend logic and all the code for the applicationâ€™s functionality.
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ controllers/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ Contains controller functions for handling incoming requests and responses. Each controller typically contains business logic for specific routes and organizes how data flows between the client, database, and application. â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ db/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ Manages the database connection setup. This directory holds files for configuring and initializing a connection to MongoDB.
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ Database.js
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ Contains the logic for connecting to MongoDB, including connection URI, options, and error handling. Responsible for establishing a connection between the application and MongoDB. â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ middlewares/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ Holds middleware functions that intercept requests to add extra processing, such as authentication, logging, or error handling, before they reach the controller. Middleware functions operate at different stages of the request lifecycle.
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ Contains Mongoose models that define the data structure and schema for each collection in MongoDB. Models specify data types, validation, and relationships, enabling MongoDB and Node.js to communicate seamlessly.
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ routes/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ Defines API endpoints for different resources and maps these endpoints to their respective controller functions. Routes act as the interface between the client requests and server responses.
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ Stores helper functions and utility modules used across the application. These are reusable pieces of code that provide common functionality (e.g., formatting, data transformation) to avoid redundancy.
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ app.js
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ Initializes the Express application, applies global middleware, and sets up API routes. This file serves as the central configuration for the applicationâ€™s request handling and middleware setup.
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ constants.js
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ Stores global constants used throughout the application, such as HTTP status codes, configuration settings, or reusable static values, which helps maintain consistency and readability.
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ index.js
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ The main entry point for the backend server. This file connects to the database, starts the Express server, and listens for incoming requests. Itâ€™s responsible for bootstrapping the application.
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ .env
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ Stores sensitive environment variables like database URI, API keys, and configuration values. It allows for secure configuration by keeping sensitive data out of the source code. â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ Specifies files and folders that should be ignored by Git for version control. This file helps prevent sensitive information or unnecessary files (like node_modules) from being committed to the repository.
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ An auto-generated file that locks the exact version of dependencies in the node_modules folder. This file ensures that the same dependency versions are installed every time the project is set up, improving consistency and stability.
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ The primary configuration file for the Node.js project, listing all dependencies, scripts, metadata, and settings. It acts as the manifest for the project and is required for installing dependencies via npm.
```
